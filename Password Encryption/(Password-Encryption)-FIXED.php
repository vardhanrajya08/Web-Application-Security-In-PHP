<!--
one of the best ways to protect the users passwords is to use the `password_hash` function like this code
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
$password = 'Mohamed';
$hashedpassword= password_hash($password,PASSWORD_DEFAULT);
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
You can also see all the ways through this link https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.password-hash.php

<?php
#Full Code.
$password = 'rajya';
$hashedpassword= password_hash($password,PASSWORD_DEFAULT);
if (password_verify($password,$hashedpassword))
{
    echo "Password is valid!";
} 
else
{
    echo "Invalid password.";
}
?>
<!--Now you will face a problem, how can you verify the correct password after the hash? Because of course we can't decrypt it
We will use the `password_verify` function to Make sure the password matches the hash
you can use this code 
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
if (password_verify($password,$hashedpassword))
{
    echo "Password is valid!";
} 
else
{
    echo "Invalid password.";
}
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
